# Scripting-CPRG217

## Description
The course introduced me to computer system scripting concepts and techniques. In addition to gaining competencies in collecting, sorting and filtering data, I learned how to produce a script with basic functionality, demonstrate error handling techniques, apply data types to process and organize data, and create tools to standardize and script system tasks. I also learned how to use programming languages like Python in conjunction with IT platforms like Ansible, as well as complete projects that reflect the needs of the industry. 

The topics covered in this course are:

Introduction to Scripting – Produce a script with basic functionality
Error Handling – Demonstrate error handling techniques
Programming Techniques – Apply data types to process and organize data
Scripting System Tasks in Linux – Create a tool to standardize system tasks using existing modules in Linux
Scripting System Tasks in Windows – Create a tool to standardize system tasks using existing modules in Windows
Working with Data – Develop script to utilize common data structure standards
Automating System Tasks – Automate system tasks in a scalable fashion using a scripting language
Ansible for Network Automation – Automate a series of tasks using Python in conjunction with Ansible
